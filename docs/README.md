## How do this work

Violent Pomodoro Technique

At 25, 55 minutes per hour, a ringing reminder bell sounds, and after 5 minutes, a ringing reminder tone works.

During the rest period, you can get up and move your muscles, stretch out, pour a cup of coffee, tidy up the table, do some simple exercise, reorganize your will, and continue your work in the next 25 minutes.

In every hours, you can hear:

- 00:00 plays C-G notes, means you start to working or learning or whatever
- 25:00 plays G-C notes, reminder you to relax for 5 min
- 30:00 plays C-G notes, means you start to working or learning or whatever
- 55:00 plays G-C notes, reminder you to relax for 5 min
